# üìä A PRACTICAL STUDY OF GENERALIZED LLMs AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS FOR FINANCIAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS  
**Author:** Onur Tuncay

This repository contains a research project aimed at evaluating the performance and optimization potential of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of financial sentiment analysis. Specifically, the study compares generalized models (Qwen 2.5) with domain-specific models (FinBERT and FiLM), highlighting their adaptability, accuracy, and limitations in handling complex financial language.

## üìå Project Overview

The project investigates how generalized and domain-specific LLMs interpret financial sentiment. It systematically applies preprocessing and fine-tuning techniques to improve classification accuracy across three sentiment categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**. The key objectives include:

- Analyzing model effectiveness using macro-averaged metrics.
- Enhancing LLM performance through preprocessing and fine-tuning.
- Comparing results with state-of-the-art financial NLP models.
- Evaluating the practical use of LLMs in real-world finance scenarios.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Due to class imbalance in the dataset, **Macro F1 Score** was selected as the primary metric.  
Other metrics included:

- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**

## üíª Experimental Setup

The experiments were conducted on Google Colab Pro+, leveraging the following hardware:

- **GPU:** NVIDIA Tesla V100 (40GB VRAM)  
- **RAM:** 83.5 GB  
- **Disk:** 235.7 GB

This environment supported:

- Efficient memory usage via gradient checkpointing  
- Mixed-precision (FP16) training  
- Large-scale transformer model fine-tuning  
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA)  
- Stable batch processing for long sequence input

## üöÄ Results & Model Evaluation

## üèÜ Model Performance Hierarchy

| Model       | Macro F1 | Œî vs Best | Key Strength          | Critical Weakness          |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Qwen 2.5** | 0.926    | -         | Neutral class (0.99)  | Positive recall (0.87)      |
| **FinBERT**  | 0.871    | -5.9%     | Balanced performance  | Negative precision (0.82)   |
| **FiLM**     | 0.869    | -6.1%     | Negative recall (0.96)| Neutral F1 consistency      |

## üîç Macro F1 Insights

### Generalized LLM Breakthrough
- Qwen 2.5's **0.926 F1** defies domain adaptation expectations, outperforming financial-specific models by **+5.5-5.7%**

### Domain Models' Tradeoffs
- FinBERT shows **most stable** F1 across classes (¬±0.04 variance)
- FiLM's negative recall (0.96) comes at precision cost (0.80) ‚Üí High false positives

### Class-Level Revelations
```text
According to results, predicting "Positive Sentiment" was the hardest task.  
‚Ä¢ Best F1 (Qwen): 0.93  
‚Ä¢ Worst F1 (FiLM): 0.83  
```
